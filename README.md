This project contains a collection of scripts to derive basic input datasets for
terrestrial ecosystem models from diverse and partially conflicting data
sources. It has been developed with a focus on the open-source dynamic global
vegetation, hydrology and crop growth model LPJmL (Lund-Potsdam-Jena with
managed Land) and complements the
[LPJmL model code release](https://github.com/PIK-LPJmL/LPJmL). This toolbox
does *not* cover climate inputs.

LandInG has been documented in the following publication:

## Structure:
  - elevation: subdirectory containing scripts to derive an elevation input
  - fertilizer: subdirectory containing scripts to derive fertilizer and manure
    inputs from various sources
  - gadm: subdirectory containing scripts to process GADM data (grid,
    country/region/district codes, land fraction in each cell etc.)
  - lakes_rivers: subdirectory containing scripts to process GLWD data and
    extract cell fractions covered by lakes and rivers
  - landuse: subdirectory containing scripts to generate a landuse dataset from
    various sources
  - river_routing: subdirectory containing scripts to derive inputs related to
    river routing
  - reservoirs: subdirectory containing scripts to derive dam/reservoir input
  - soil: subdirectory containing scripts to derive soil inputs

  - lpjml_format_helper_functions.R: script defining a number of utility
    functions to work with the LPJmL input format

## How to use
  - Normally, you will run the scripts in the `gadm` directory first, which
    generate a grid file that is used by all the other input generating scripts.
  - In order to run LPJmL with the most basic settings, you will also need a
    soil input, which is generated by the script in `soil`, and a lake input,
    which is generated by the scripts in `lakes_rivers`.
  - In order to use LPJmL with river routing, you will also need to run the
    scripts in `river_routing`.
  - In order to use LPJmL with reservoirs, you will need data generated by the
    scripts in `river_routing` and need to run the scripts in `reservoirs` and
    `elevation`.
  - Scripts in `landuse` require not only the grid, but also grid-to-country and
    grid-to-region data generated by the scripts in `gadm`.
  - Scripts in `fertilizer` require a grid and data generated by the scripts in
    `gadm` and `landuse`.

README files in each subdirectory provide additional information.
