# Landuse input
-----
This directory contains scripts to generate a landuse input dataset.

## Input
The subdirectories included in this directory are for the various source
datasets used to generate the landuse dataset. See README file in each
subdirectory for further instructions regarding each source dataset.

The scripts in this directory require data generated by the scripts in `../gadm`
so make sure to run these first.

## Software requirements
- `R`
- R packages `abind`, `data.table`, `ncdf4`, `raster`, `stringi`, `udunits2`
- shell scripts in /HYDE32 require `bash`, `cdo`, `nco`, `zip`

## Files included in this directory
- aggregate_cft_timeseries.R: Script aggregates full list of crops included in
  FAOSTAT/Monfreda to CFTs simulated by LPJmL
- aggregate_cft_timeseries_SLURM.sh: Example batch script to run
  aggregate_cft_timeseries.R as a job on the PIK cluster
- cft_input_timeseries.R: Script generates landuse inputs in final LPJmL format
- cft_input_timeseries_SLURM.sh: Example batch script to run
  cft_input_timeseries.R as a job on the PIK cluster
- harvested_area_timeseries.R: Script disaggregates country time series of
  rainfed and irrigated harvested areas to the grid
- harvested_area_timeseries_SLURM.sh: Example batch script to run
  harvested_area_timeseries.R as a job on the PIK cluster
- country_level_data.R: Script that matches crops between FAOSTAT and Monfreda
  at the country scale
- crop_types_aquastat.csv, crop_types_FAOSTAT_LPJmL_default.csv,
  crop_type_Monfreda_FAOSTAT_MIRCA.csv: Mappings between crop naming schemas
  used in the different source datasets
- harvested_fraction.R: Script converts gridded harvested areas from Monfreda
  into harvested fractions, provides gap filling and removes some pattern
  artefacts caused by mismatches in country masks
- harvested_fraction_SLURM.sh: Example batch script to run harvested_fraction.R
  as a job on the PIK cluster
- landuse_setup.R: This file contains most settings used by all the other R
  scripts in this directory. You have to set up filenames to files downloaded
  for the various source datasets, units etc.
- multi_cropping_suitability_GAEZ.R: Script calculates multicropping suitability
  based on agro-climatic resources from GAEZ
- read_AQUASTAT.R: Script reads data downloaded from AQUASTAT database and
  converts format for further use. This script can be run in interactive or
  non-interactive mode to deal with values with additional metadata
- read_FAOSTAT.R: Script reads data downloaded from FAOSTAT database and
  converts format for further use.
- r_modules.sh: Loads modules on the PIK cluster required to run R with all the
  packages used by the scripts in this directory
- split_global_harvested_areas_into_rainfed_irrigated.R: Script combines MIRCA
  and AQUASTAT with FAOSTAT to derive rainfed and irrigated harvested areas at
  the country scale

## How to use
- Collect source datasets following README in each subdirectory
- Fill out setup in `landuse_setup.R`
- Generate a timeseries of gridded crop-specific harvested areas
	1) `read_FAOSTAT.R`
	2) `country_level_data.R` (requires step 1)
	3) `harvested_fraction.R` (requires step 2)
	4) `read_AQUASTAT.R` (does not require steps 1 to 3)
	5) `multi_cropping_suitability_GAEZ.R` (does not require steps 1 to 4)
	6) `split_global_harvested_areas_into_rainfed_irrigated.R` (requires steps 1
      to 5)
	7) `harvested_area_timeseries.R` (requires steps 1 to 6)
- Aggregate crop-specific harvested areas to crop-functional types (CFTs)
	8) `aggregate_cft_timeseries.R` (requires steps 1 to 7)
- Convert timeseries of CFT-specific harvested areas into input for LPJmL
	9) `cft_input_timeseries.R` (requires steps 1 to 8)
