## Script to derive neighbour cells for neighbour irrigation.                 ##
## LPJmL allows irrigation water in a cell to be withdrawn from water bodies  ##
## in that cell plus one neighbour cell, suggesting water transfer by         ##
## conveyance systems or transportation by trucks over limited distances.     ##
## The neighbour cell selected is the cell within the search area with the    ##
## largest upstream area (as a proxy for large discharge).                    ##
## The search area may either be restricted to cells directly bordering the   ##
## cell or to cells within a certain radius.                                  ##
## Additionally, upstream and downstream cells of a cell may be excluded as   ##
## neighbour cells.                                                           ##
## Using a search radius larger than 1 cell is much slower than using only    ##
## direct neighbours. Therefore, the script allows parallelization.           ##
## The parallelization mechanism is implemented through foreach which has     ##
## backends for several parallelization mechanisms. This script has options   ##
## for the doMPI backend (using MPI) and the doParallel backend. Further      ##
## are possible. The example below may not work on your system. Try to adjust ##
## parameters or set "cluster <- FALSE" to switch off parallelization.        ##
##                                                                            ##
## Info:                                                                      ##
## Processing a global grid at 0.5Â° takes a few minutes on a single CPU for   ##
## "adjacent" search or "region" search with a 75km search radius.            ##
## Parallelization provides only marginal speed gains.                        ##
## Processing a global grid at 5 arcmin spatial resolution takes about 2 to 3 ##
## hours on a single CPU for "adjacent" search and about 2 hours with         ##
## parallelization on 48 CPUs for "region" search with a 75km search radius.  ##
